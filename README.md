Deployment Plan:

1. Dockerize the application
2. Use Uvicorn + Gunicorn with Nginx for production
3. Store uploaded files in cloud storage (optional)
4. Use HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
5. Deploy on free-tier cloud VM (e.g., Railway, Render, or Fly.io)
6. Set up database backups and monitor logs using a service like UptimeRobot
